# Usage Explorer

Monitor and analyze your xAI API usage with the Usage Explorer.

## Overview

The Usage Explorer in the xAI Console provides:
- Real-time usage tracking
- Historical usage data
- Cost breakdown by model
- API key-level analytics

## Accessing Usage Explorer

1. Go to console.x.ai
2. Navigate to "Usage" or "Usage Explorer"
3. Select your team

## Viewing Usage

### Usage Dashboard

The dashboard shows:
- Total tokens consumed
- Total cost
- Request count
- Usage trends over time

### Grouping Options

Group usage data by:
- **API Key**: Compare test vs production keys
- **Model**: See usage per model
- **Day/Week/Month**: Time-based analysis
- **Endpoint**: Usage by API endpoint

Example: Compare consumptions across test and production API keys by selecting "Group by: API Key"

## Filtering

Filter usage data by:
- Date range
- API key
- Model
- Team member

## Usage Metrics

|--------|-------------|
| Input tokens | Tokens sent to the model |
| Output tokens | Tokens generated by the model |
| Cached tokens | Tokens served from cache |
| Reasoning tokens | Tokens used for reasoning (Grok 4) |
| Total tokens | Sum of all token types |

### Cost Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Input cost | Cost of input tokens |
| Output cost | Cost of output tokens |
| Tool cost | Cost of tool invocations |
| Total cost | Sum of all costs |

### Request Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Request count | Number of API requests |
| Success rate | Percentage of successful requests |
| Error rate | Percentage of failed requests |
| Avg latency | Average response time |

## Cost Optimization Insights

The Usage Explorer may show:
- Cache hit rates
- Opportunities to use cheaper models
- High-cost operations
- Unused API keys

## Team Usage

For team admins:
- See usage by team member
- Identify heavy users
- Allocate budgets
- Set per-user limits

## API Access

Access usage data programmatically:

```python
# Using Management API
response = requests.get(
    "https://management-api.x.ai/v1/usage",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {management_key}"},
    params={
        "start_date": "2024-01-01",
        "end_date": "2024-01-31",
        "group_by": "model"
    }
)

usage_data = response.json()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular monitoring**: Check usage weekly
2. **Set alerts**: Prevent surprise bills
3. **Compare periods**: Identify trends
4. **Optimize high-cost operations**: Review expensive requests
5. **Clean up unused keys**: Remove inactive API keys
